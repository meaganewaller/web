## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This is where all the magic happens for [my software development blog](https://meaganwaller.com). It's built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. All the content is served by [a Rails JSON API](https://github.com/meaganewaller/devblog-api). It's the virtual home where I write about programming, web development, software consulting, professional development, and more.

Enjoy! ðŸŒ¸
