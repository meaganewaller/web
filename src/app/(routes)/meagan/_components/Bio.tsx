          I wrote my first line of HTML on Microsoft Notepad in 2004 and fell head-over-heels for how magical it all
          felt

        I spent a couple days working up the courage to convince my parents to put their credit card information into a
        form on a website and buy me a domain. They did. And my first website was born. I learned everything, HTML/CSS,
        creating graphics in Paint Shop Pro and Animation Shop, and getting my website live, by reading posts written by
        kids my age. Soon I started writing my own posts sharing my knowledge, my pitfalls, my cool experiments.

        <strong>I didn&apos;t jump straight into the tech industry</strong>. As school got more demanding and with the
        freedom that having my driver&apos;s license allowed me, I stopped updating my sites. I still always came back
        to it in some capacity. Running a MySpace layout page, creating a message board for a band I liked, running an
        eCommerce site with my friends to sell shirts we designed. I didn&apos;t know at the time that what I was doing
        could be a career. I entered into college to be an elementary school teacher but dropped out after failing a
        course titled College Success (twice). I&apos;ve <Link href="/talks">talked about that experience a lot</Link>.

        I bounced between retail and foodservice jobs for a while, still unsure of what I wanted to do. There was a
        software apprenticeship program looking for apprentices in Tampa near the city that I lived in. It felt like
        serendipity. I replied to the job posting and was invited to come into the office. After hearing more about the
        role, I asked how I could join the program. The application process was to build an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game.
        Up until this point, I had written mostly HTML/CSS and a little bit of PHP.

        <strong>Sharing things on the web isn&apos;t new for me</strong>. I&apos;ve been sharing (and let&apos;s face
        it, oversharing) online for over 15 years. This blog is a continuation of that impulse, a little more
        professional, a little more focused, but at its roots is the seed planted by me as a preteen.
